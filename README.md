# statafiles
a collection of stata .do files from my undergraduate work

This repository includes 3 projects: my undergraduate thesis and my two major capstone projects.
My undergraduate thesis used data that I collected myself and a Cox Proportional Hazard Regression
to predict how anti-social behavior in a reality dating show changed contestants' odds of winning.

My capstone projects were:
a simulatenous equations supply and demand model of black & green tea,
focusing on US demand and global supply challenges. 
a Oaxacan regression model describing how immigration status affects the
wages of farm workers in the United States.
